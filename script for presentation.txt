Slide Title: APPLICATION OF ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS in Computer Science

"Assalamualaikum everyone!
I‚Äôm Arman Hossen Ripon, ID 241-15-883, and today I‚Äôll show you how
math powers the digital world‚Äîbecause computer science isn‚Äôt just 
about coding‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs math in action!

Let‚Äôs dive into three key areas where engineering mathematics drives innovation:



"First    ‚ÄîGraph Theory: the backbone of networks.
Ever wonder how GPS finds the fastest route or how social media 
suggests friends? Algorithms use graphs to map connections and 
optimize paths‚Äîturning abstract nodes and edges into real-world tools."


"Next    ‚ÄîLinear Algebra: the engine of AI.
Machine learning thrives on vectors and matrices. They crunch massive 
datasets to train models‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Netflix recommending your next 
show or facial recognition unlocking your phone."


"Finally    ‚ÄîProbability: the wizard of uncertainty.
It predicts risks, fine-tunes spam filters, and even helps self-driving 
cars make split-second decisions. Without it, big data would be chaos!"


"Together, these turn equations into the tech we rely on daily."


lets discuss about , 
Slide Title: """""" Real-Life Example ‚Äîlike, ,,, SMART CITIES


you can see, math doesn‚Äôt stop there  ‚Äîit‚Äôs building the cities of tomorrow.

Take calculus: it optimizes traffic lights to cut commute times and pollution.

Linear algebra? It balances renewable energy in power grids. like, solar, or wind 

And probability predicts infrastructure failures‚Äîbefore a bridge cracks or a pipe bursts.



The result? Efficient, sustainable urban living      
‚Äîproving math isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the invisible hand shaping our future.

"That‚Äôs all for my part‚Äînow over to my teammate Naim to take it further!"
