Deque: Double Ended Queue
deque<int> d = {1,2,3};

"dequeue" and "deque" are not same
Deque: Double Ended Queue
dequeue: means pop any element form a Queue

deque : dynamic arrays used so random access possible
list : dubly linkedlist so no random access

so if we use listVariable[2] gives error
ana we use dequeVariable[2] it will give the value

#include<deque> has to be included to our program to use it


imagin a list, which has two ends , like a pipe, 

- push_back & push_front
- emplace_back & emplace_front
- pop_back & pop_front

//it can use functions like
size, erase, clear, begin, end,
rbegin, rend, insert, front, back
