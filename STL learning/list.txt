list (works as doubly linked list)
list<int> l = {1,2,3};

we include <list>
#include<list>

here we can 
    - push from 'back' and push from "front".
    - pop from 'back' and pop from "front".





list    
    - push_back & push_front
    - emplace_back & emplace_front
    - pop_back & pop_front

    //size, erase, clear, begin, end, rbegin,
    rend,insert, front, back - this are use full in both 
    vector and list, 
    //just the differece in list is here i can push/emplace/pop_front
    vector is dynamic array
    list is doubly linkedlist
